## Introduction

By now, everyone is familiar with AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). This guide explores how these tools can help developers transition from junior to senior roles by leveraging AI capabilities effectively.

## Field Experience

This guide is based on months of hands-on experience with various LLMs including:
- ChatGPT
- GitHub Copilot
- Claude
- Gemini
- Other LLMs

## Understanding ChatGPT and LLMs

ChatGPT is an AI chatbot using natural language processing to create human-like dialogue. While it doesn't think, it effectively applies learned rules to generate responses for:
- Code generation
- Content writing
- Problem-solving assistance
- Documentation
